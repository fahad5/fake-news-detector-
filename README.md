Fake News Detection Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Classification Modeling
problem statment :
Early in 2019, WhatsApp announced it was deleting over 2 million accounts a month to prevent the rampant spread of fake news.1 Their decision came after incidents of violent attacks in India were triggered by the spread of fake news on the messaging platform.2 I was curious about how WhatsApp created their fake news filter, so I made one myself using open source data from Reddit. I scraped around 30,000 posts from subreddits r/TheOnion and r/nottheonion and built a classification model that could distinguish between fake news from r/TheOnion and absurd news from r/nottheonion. While building this model, I optimized for accuracy. That is, I wanted to have the highest possible outcomes of True Negatives and True Positives, and least amount of False Positives and False Negatives. The worse scenario is deleting an account or post that shares authentic news, mistaking it for fake news. After cleaning, analyzing, and performing NLP functions to the data, I created optimal classification models using Pipeline and GridSearch to help me determine the best parameters for my model. The classification model with the highest accuracy score of 90% vectorized the data using CountVectorizer(ngram_range= (1, 3)) and trained the data using MultinomialNB(alpha = 0.36). Additionally, to interpret coefficients of the model, I used CountVectorizer(stop_words = custom) & LogisticRegression(C = 1.0, solver='liblinear'). See more of my findings in the Model Evaluation section of this Readme.

Model Selection:
Throug Pipeline and Gridsearch, I tested four sets of models with unique parameters. My best model in terms of highest accuracy score was Model 3. My best model in terms of coefficient interpretability was Model 1.

Model 1 | Best Coefficient Interpretability:
CountVectorizer(stop_words=None, ngram_range=(1,1))
LogisticRegression(C=1, solver='liblinear')

Train score 0.96
Test score 0.87
Model 2:
TfidfVectorizer(max_df=0.75, min_df=3, n_gram=(1,3))
LogisticRegression(C=1, solver='liblinear')

Train score 0.92
Test score 0.86
Model 3 | Best Accuracy Score:
CountVectorizer(stop_words=None, ngram_range=(1,3))
MultinomialNB(alpha=0.36)

Train score 0.997
Test score 0.90
Model 4:
TfidfVectorizer(max_df = .75, min_df = 4, ngram_range=(1,2))
MultinomialNB(alpha=0.1)

Train score 0.92
Test score 0.87


Conclusions and Next Steps:
While I did achieve a high accuracy of around 90%, it's still not perfect. If WhatsApp were to implement this model when deleting 2 million accounts a month, they would be misclassifying about 10% - 11% of authentic accounts as fake ones. When implementing machine learning models to block, delete, or censor social media and messaging accounts, how many are misclassified? In my next iteration of this project, I would do more research on whether and how platforms like WhatsApp create fake news filters, and what their accuracy and misclassification scores are. Additionally, since news gets spread not only as text but also as images and videos, my next step would also be to research how to implement a machine learning model on multi-media objects.
